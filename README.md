# **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System**

This project implements an **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** recommendation system, which suggests movies similar to a given movie based on user ratings.

## **üìå Project Structure**
The system consists of several key scripts:

| File | Description |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `download.py` | Downloads the dataset from Kaggle and stores it in a local directory. |
| `item_based_filtering.py` | Main script that loads ratings, calculates similarity, and recommends movies. |
| `config.json` | Stores the dataset path to avoid hardcoding it inside scripts. |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists the required Python dependencies. |

## **üöÄ How to Install and Run**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It is recommended to run the project in a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python installed and then install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The `requirements.txt` includes:
```
kagglehub
pandas
ipython
scikit-learn
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Download the Dataset**
Before running the recommendation system, you need to download the dataset. Run:
```bash
python download.py
```
This will fetch the dataset from Kaggle and store it in:
```
~/.cache/kagglehub/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/versions/7
```
If you prefer to move the dataset to another location, you can do so and then update the path in **`config.json`**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Dataset Path**
If the dataset is stored in a different location, edit `config.json` and set the correct path:
```json
{
    "dataset_path": "~/.cache/kagglehub/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/versions/7"
}
```
This ensures the system knows where to find the required CSV files.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Movie Recommendation System**
To get movie recommendations for a given title, run:
```bash
python item_based_filtering.py "The Godfather"
```
üìå The output will display **similar movies** along with their **genres, average rating, and vote count**.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Update the Similarity Matrix (Only When Needed)**
The similarity matrix is cached to **avoid recalculating it every time**, which speeds up execution. However, if you update the dataset or want to recompute the similarity matrix, run:
```bash
python item_based_filtering.py "The Godfather" --update
```
This **recomputes and saves the similarity matrix**, preventing redundant recalculations in future runs.

## **üìå Understanding the Output**
The output displays the **top similar movies** based on user ratings.

Example:
```
Recommendations for 'The Godfather':
             title  movieId                                              genres  vote_average  vote_count

 A Little Princess    19101                              Drama, Family, Fantasy           7.4       207.0
   Johnny Mnemonic     9886 Adventure, Action, Drama, Science Fiction, Thriller           5.5       380.0
           Georgia    97406                                               Drama           6.1        15.0

```

### **Explanation of Columns**
- **`title`** ‚Üí Name of the recommended movie.
- **`movieId`** ‚Üí Unique ID of the movie.
- **`genres`** ‚Üí Genres associated with the movie.
- **`vote_average`** ‚Üí Average user rating from the dataset.
- **`vote_count`** ‚Üí Number of votes the movie has received.

---

## **üìå Notes**
- The system **uses user ratings** to compare movies, meaning the recommendations are **collaborative-based, not content-based**.
- It **does NOT require user input preferences**, as it analyzes collective ratings.
- If the dataset is updated, use `--update` to **recompute the similarity matrix**.
